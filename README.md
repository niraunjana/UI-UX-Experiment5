# EX_05_UX Research and Design Exploration through Two Real-World Scenarios: Health App and E-Commerce Platform


## Aim:

To understand and practice the core stages of the UX process by identifying user problems, selecting appropriate research methods, and creating detailed user personas for two different digital product scenarios: a health monitoring app and an e-commerce website. The goal is to build empathy with users and align product solutions to their needs through research-driven design.

## Algorithm:

1. Select Two UX Project Scenarios
   Choose two diverse application domains (e.g., Health App & E-commerce Site) for the case study.

2. Identify User Pain Points
   Analyze potential problems users face in each domain by observing common user journeys and frustrations.

3. Write Problem Statements
   Frame clear UX problem statements using the template:
  "[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."

4. Select Research Methods
   Choose suitable user research techniques (e.g., interviews, surveys, usability testing) based on the target users and product type. Justify your selections.

5. Create Personas
   Develop at least two user personas for each scenario, including demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, and motivations. Ensure the personas are based on user types that represent key audience segments.

## Result:

Two real-world UX project scenarios were successfully analyzed by identifying user needs, writing clear problem statements, selecting suitable research methods, and creating empathetic user personas. This process helped establish a strong foundation for user-centered design decisions tailored to health and e-commerce applications.
